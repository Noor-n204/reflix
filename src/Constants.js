Shiprweck, parents mauled by a jaguar. Luckily, a troop of gorillas took him in, but the Big Daddy gorilla never took a liking to him. That is, until the end when it's too late. Why is it too late? Watch and find out." },

Alas, he is dubbed 'Wart' early on, and it was all downhill from there for a while. On a hunting trip he falls in on Merlin, literally. Merlin is a possibly-mentally-unstable-and-ethically-dubious Wizard that turns Arthur into a literate, at-one-point harassed squirrel. Watch to find out what the heck that means." },
    { id: 4, isRented: false, title: "Beauty and the Beast", year: 2016, img: "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ArFYSFGJL.jpg", descrShort: "Basically the same as the original, except now Hermi-- Emma Wattson plays Belle, fittingly so some would say, given how actively progressive she is regarding women's rights. Rumor has it that in the bonus scenes she whips out a wand and turns Gaston into a toad, but in order to watch those scenes you need to recite a certain incantation." }
